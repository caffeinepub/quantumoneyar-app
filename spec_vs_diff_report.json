  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/components/sections/Profile.tsx with fixes for REQ-1 (coins captured), REQ-2 (XP bar), REQ-3 (canister ID links), and REQ-4 (game stats section). Most requirements appear to be addressed based on the truncated diff, but full verification is limited by the truncation. The CANISTER_IDS array is present with all five correct canister IDs, XP progress calculation uses getXpProgress helper mapped to Math.min(..., 100), and coinsCapturado uses lockedCoins/totalQMY fallback. However, the diff is truncated so JSX rendering of the bar width, anchor tags, and stats section cannot be fully confirmed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "XP bar width is computed as Math.min((currentXP / nextLevelXP) * 100, 100) percent; bar is never 0% when currentXP > 0",
      "reason": "The diff shows xpProgressPct = Math.min(getXpProgress(xp), 100) which delegates to getXpProgress helper rather than directly computing Math.min((currentXP / nextLevelXP) * 100, 100). Without seeing the getXpProgress implementation or the JSX rendering the bar width, we cannot confirm the bar actually uses xpProgressPct as its style width. The diff is truncated before the JSX section.",
