  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to only two files: frontend-file-summaries.txt (a metadata/documentation file listing component descriptions) and project_state.json (a project state tracking file). Neither file contains actual implementation code for the three requirements. The diff does not show any changes to authentication configuration, canister ID constants, useActor hooks, or localStorage clearing logic. All three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) appear unimplemented in the actual frontend source code.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Configure Internet Identity authentication in quantumoneyar.app to use exclusively identity.ic0.app as the identity provider",
      "reason": "No changes to AuthClient initialization or identity provider configuration are visible in the diff. The frontend-file-summaries.txt mentions Internet Identity authentication in Wallet.tsx description but no actual code change implementing identityProvider set to https://identity.ic0.app is present.",

      "reason": "No changes to canister ID configuration files, environment variables, or useActor hook implementations are present in the diff. The BCQPanel.tsx summary mentions updated Additional Canister ID but no actual canister ID values are shown or verified in the diff.",

      "requirement": "Clear all stale identity and session data from localStorage/sessionStorage on app initialization and force a fresh Internet Identity login",
      "reason": "No changes to app initialization logic, localStorage clearing routines, or session management code are present in the diff. The Header.tsx summary mentions logout clearing all query cache but this is logout behavior, not initialization-time stale session clearing.",
